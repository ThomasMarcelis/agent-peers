# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-03

First public release.

- Local discovery and direct messaging between Claude Code and Codex sessions.
- Native Hermes plugin with private, conversation-specific reply inboxes and exact Discord thread routing on the documented host fork.
- Standalone CLI and Codex MCP server, with help, version, JSON discovery, and read-only diagnostics.
- Hardened socket ownership, registry validation, framing, resource bounds, reconnects, and subprocess cleanup.
- Deterministic transport/MCP tests, native Hermes integration tests, package-installation checks, and Linux/macOS CI.

Requires Node.js 22+. Hermes automatic replies require the fork APIs listed in the [compatibility guide](docs/compatibility.md); stock Hermes is not yet supported for sending. Agent protocols are version-sensitive.
